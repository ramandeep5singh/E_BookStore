Discover how to become a six-figure developer without going back to school.
Are you thinking of transitioning into a career as a software developer?

Have you always been interested in programming languages and tinkering with technology?

Do you wish there was a straightforward way to gain all the skills and knowledge you need to write your own programs?

If you're looking to make a living as a Java programmer, you're in luck.

According to HackerRank, Java is now the third most in-demand language that hiring managers look for.

And with US Java developers now earning upwards of $105,000 on average, based on data from Indeed... You can rest assured that learning Java will pay off in more ways than one.

But for many, the problem is knowing where to start.

If you're coming from a non-tech background... or if you're self-taught and only know bits and pieces of Java... then learning how to code can feel like flying blindfolded.

Because even if you manage to grasp all the basic beginner concepts... you'll still need to ace your first coding challenge if you want to land your dream job as a developer.

And that's where this book comes in.
