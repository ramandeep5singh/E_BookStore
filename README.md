# E_BookStore

## Project Overview
E_BookStore is my college project that provides a platform for buying books online. The website is designed to help users browse different categories of books and place orders. It also includes an admin panel to manage orders and inventory. This project was developed as part of my B.Tech curriculum at the University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Kurukshetra (2020-2024).
